# New_Ultimate_Event

 ## New updated version of Ultimate Event

# Features

1. Email Verification: Implements a robust email verification process during registration for both Organizers and Participants. This ensures the authenticity of users and prevents the creation of accounts with fraudulent email addresses.
2. Domain-Specific Event Visibility: Facilitates a domain-restricted visibility of events. For instance, an Organizer affiliated with Augustana College (using an @augustana.edu email) will have their events exclusively visible to participants with verified Augustana College email addresses. This feature ensures a targeted and relevant audience for each event.
3. User Interaction with Events: Allows users to actively engage with event listings. Participants have the capability to register for events, withdraw from events, and view a history of events they have attended, enhancing user engagement and experience.
4. Organizer Management Tools: Provides Organizers with comprehensive management tools for their events. Organizers can monitor registrations, create new events, view upcoming and past events they have organized. This suite of tools aids in efficient event management and tracking.
